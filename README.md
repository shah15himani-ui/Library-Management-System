# Library-Management-System
Understanding of core programming concepts and object-oriented programming (OOP) principles.
Building a real-world application, even a simple one, really connects the dots between syntax and practical problem-solving.
Key features I implemented:
📘 Book Management: Functionality to add new books to the inventory.
👥 User/Member Management: Systems to register new users and track their details.
🔄 Borrowing & Returning: Logic to handle the process of issuing and returning books, including tracking availability and due dates.
🔎 Search & View: The ability to display all books and allow users to search for specific titles.
💾 Data Handling: Used file handling (or a basic database) to ensure persistent storage of all records.
This project provided invaluable practical experience. Learned the foundational skills necessary to build this system using the PythonX learning app. The key takeaways for me were:
Structuring a program with functions and control flow.
The essential process of debugging and finding workable solutions for coding challenges.
The satisfaction of seeing a functional application come to life!
